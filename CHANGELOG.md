# MUI Version Changelog

## 1.2
* More tweaks to the menus. Popup menus can be justified left/right/center. Removed quite a few fudge factors.
* Added a notion of a control (per window) having the 'focus'. Currently listboxes and text edit boxes can have the focus.

## 1.1 -- since the release of the original verison
* Added support for horizontal scrollbars.
* Added a faster (vectorized) version of an obvious 'cg' function.
* Fixed a problem with mui_timers. Also typed it now.
* Added a bunch of extra comments to mui.h
* Added a *fully justified* text style for text boxes.

## 1.0 -- original version
* Initial release. Doh.
